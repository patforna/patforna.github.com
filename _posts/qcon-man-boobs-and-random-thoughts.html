I just came back from <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/conference/">QCon</a> and my head still feels very fragmented with a number of random thoughts.<br /><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> and </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin's</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> keynote</span> called '<a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/Does+my+Bus+look+big+in+this%3F">Does my Bus look big in this</a>' mercilessly dissected current middleware approaches. It was and extraordinarily sharp-witted and entertaining talk in which they used their entire linguistic repertoire to pick on middleware vendors and conceive <span style="font-style: italic;">beautifully eloquent metaphors</span> such as "man boobs" (instead of bluntly calling it fat, ugly, bloated middleware products).<br /><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/Kent%20Beck.htm">Kent Beck's</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/Keynote%3ATrends+in+Agile+Development">keynote</a> was also quite interesting. He thinks that in the future we will write (even) more tests, deploy applications more frequently (apparently <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> does it every 30 minutes!), work in teams that are more distributed, and solve more complex problems. He also believes that with the rise of a new generation of tech savvy business people, software developers will increasingly loose their 'wizard status' and need to invest more in their non-technical skills.<br /><br /><a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/Blending+Java+with+dynamic+languages">Venkat Subramaniam</a> and <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/Evolving+the+JVM">Ola Bini</a> both talked about using <span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic languages in Java and the JVM</span>. Through <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR 223</a>, Java 6 now includes support to run a range of scripting languages.  I was very pleased to see <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/Blending+Java+with+dynamic+languages">Venkat</a> demoing some <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> stuff that ran embedded in Java because we did the same with some <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code on a client project just a few weeks ago.<br /><br />In his <a href="http://jaoo.dk/london-2008/presentation/A+couple+of+ways+to+skin+an+Internet-scale+cat">second talk</a>, <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim</a> moaned a bit more about <span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Services and the Web's architecture</span>. He showed some pretty interesting ideas that use existing Web infrastructure (i.e. no WS-*) for integrating applications and realizing business workflows.<br /><br />Finally, I visited a <span style="font-weight: bold;">birds of a feather session with </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://blog.springframework.com/rod/">Rod Johnson</a>. His appearance, however, did not necessarily remind me of a sunny, friendly day in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>... ;)
