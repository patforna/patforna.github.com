Today, I've looked into <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wea2sca5.aspx" target="_blank">MSBuild</a> for the first time, because I wanted to give my build process a <span style="font-style: italic;">tiny bit</span> more intelligence than what can be achieved with clicking around in Visual Studio. I've been using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/" target="_blank">maven 1.x</a> (and later <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">maven2</a>) for almost 3 years now for building projects and so I felt a bit like traveling back in time, when I was confronted with the ant-like MSBuild stuff.<br /><br />This alone got me into a bit of a bad mood already, because I've spent hours for what would have taken me minutes with <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">maven</a>. Trying to generate the API docs however gave me the rest. I've heard of a tool called <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">NDoc</a> for generating API documentation from the C# source code. I browsed to the NDoc site and frowned when I saw that the "latest" news were more than two years old. Still, I downloaded it and was even more surprised that it asked me to install .NET Framework 1.1 (I'm developing with .NET 3.0!). Patiently, I also took this hurdle. Then, however, *kaboom* NDoc complained that it can't handle the XML Visual Studio 2005 generated. I googled a bit and realized that the latest release of NDoc apparently does not work with .NET Framework 2.0 or later. However, there was a reference on a <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=110491&SiteID=1" target="_blank">MSDN forum</a> to a <a href="http://jonas.lagerblad.com/blog/?p=4" target="_blank">blog of a guy</a> that patched (!) the latest NDoc version so that it would <span style="font-style: italic;">kind of run</span> with .NET 2.0 or later.<br /><br />After some tweaking with this patch, I achieved some results. However, it was rather disappointing: Links were broken, Generics are not supported and it just didn't look ok.<br /><br />I don't want to bitch about the authors of NDoc. I think they deserve lots of credit for doing something for the community and nobody can blame them, if they don't have time to continue. However, I think it's quite unbelievable that Microsoft releases .NET SDKs without a documentation tool. I mean not that I like MSDN documentation better than JavaDoc, but we've had tools for creating clean <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/" target="_blank">JavaDoc</a> for probably more than 10 years now... Oh yeah... I forgot, of course there's one tool called <a href="http://www.doc-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">doc-o-matic</a> that seems to do a decent job creating documentation; provided you don't mind paying the 500 USD license fee...<br /><br />I still feel that i <span style="font-style: italic;">must have</span> overlooked something, because it somehow just doesn't want to get into my head to think that there is no such support. All the Microsoft links in the SDK pointed either to NDoc or to Nirvana (i.e. were broken). Please, correct me if I'm wrong!
