A few months ago I was in New York and played around with an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a> for about half an hour. I really loved it and I immediately knew that I wanted to get one as soon as they would be available in the UK. At that time, a lot of reports circulated the web that described how to unlock the device and make it work on non AT&amp;T networks. However, I wanted the phone for one particular reason: to surf the web when I'm on the run. Because Apple seems to be in a position where they can just ignore the European market, they decided to equip the phone with support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDGE" target="_blank">EDGE</a> only and refrain from implementing support for much more up-to-date <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" target="_blank">3G </a>standards and technologies that are available in Europe.<br /><br />Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, however, seems to be cool enough, to make network providers adapt their technologies to one single device and so O2 started "upgrading" their network to EDGE a while ago. Since yesterday they are proudly offering the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a> as part of an <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/iPhone" target="_blank">18 months contract</a> for a whopping £ 269.-. The contract costs £ 35.- per month and apparently the EDGE coverage doesn't go very far beyond major city hubs.<br /><br />Doing the maths: I can get an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a> for the equivalent of £ 190.-, so why on earth would I pay an extra £ 79.- just to lock myself into an 18 months contract?!<br /><br />Ok, I know it's far from being perfect, but I still really like the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>. However, not so much as that I would volunteer to being ripped off and carry some extra cash to the feet of some companies that are swimming in money already.<br /><br />Yet looking at the queues in front of most London phone shops yesterday evening, there still seems to be a good number of people that don't see it this way.
