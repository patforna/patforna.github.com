To my great horror I today realized that it has been more than 2 months since I've emitted some signs of life to the outside world via my blog. In fact, I've written my last post just before I left Sydney and a great deal of things have actually happened in the meantime.<br /><br />After the marathon-flight back from Oz to Europe I spent a few days in Switzerland and then went straight to London to catch up with Noelia and to continue writing on my thesis. Three weeks later I flew to New York and spent the weekend with my ex-colleague and friend Luki. Then, I continued to Boston in order to present the <a href="http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/%7Ehws/CBSE10/proceedings.shtml" target="_blank">paper</a> that <a href="http://jim.webber.name/" target="_blank">Jim</a>, <a href="http://www.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/%7Eiango/home/IGHome.htm" target="_blank">Ian</a> and me had written a while ago at <a href="http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/%7Ehws/CBSE10/" target="_blank">CBSE</a>. Of course, I didn't miss the chance to check out Boston and its great universities.<br /><br />Back in Switzerland I put the finishing touches to my thesis and finally, finally, finally submitted it *phuuu*. I was really happy and relieved to get this behind me and I'm now basically waiting for the examiners to read through it and then get back to me with their verdict in about two months or so.<br /><br />Having the thesis completed and submitted, I was able to enjoy my cousin's wedding in Trapani (Sicily) to the fullest. It was great to spend some days with my family and to see relatives that I hadn't seen since I had gone to Oz. After the wedding, Noelia and me spent another week exploring beautiful Sicily, including Stromboli, Taormina, Siracusa, Agrigento and Palermo. Neither one of us had been in Sicily before and we were both completely overwhelmed by the island's beauty, its unbelievable rich culture and history, the great food and the perpetual deep blue skies. Unfortunately, my <a href="http://pat.iserver.ch/gallery/" target="_blank">photo gallery</a> is not working at the moment, but I'll post some pictures as soon as it is running again.<br /><br />Now I'm back in London sipping coffee and finally having some time to blog. In fact, it was a very happy day, because I've *finally* received an offer from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a> and signed the contracts to start working at the 3rd of September. I'm really glad that it has worked out and super excited to start working =)<br /><br />Tomorrow, I'm heading back to Switzerland to go to the <a href="http://www.streetparade.ch/" target="_blank">Streetparade</a> and then spend some time relaxing and catching up with family and friends before returning back to the real world at the end of August...<br /><br />... actually, the real world seems to be catching up with me faster than expected, because I just realized that I'm meant to look at some (ridiculously expensive) London flats in a few minutes...</div>
