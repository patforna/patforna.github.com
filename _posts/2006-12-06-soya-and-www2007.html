I'm currently working on a thesis as part of my <a href="http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/research/programs/2006/2765.html" target="_blank">MSc by research</a> degree at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">UNSW</a>. The goal of my work is to determine whether the message-centric approach taken by the <a href="http://www.ssdl.org/" target="_blank">SOAP Service Description Language (SSDL)</a> has significant benefits for describing Web Services compared to the incumbent approaches (e.g. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl" target="_blank">WSDL</a>).<br /><br />To that end I'm developing <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soya" target="_blank">Soya</a>, which is an open-source programming model and runtime environment for creating and enacting <a href="http://www.ssdl.org/" target="_blank">SSDL</a> contracts. I will employ <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soya" target="_blank">Soya</a> in a number of case studies to collect empirical data that will serve as the basis for the comparisons.<br /><br /><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soya" target="_blank">Soya</a> is built on top of the <a href="http://wcf.netfx3.com/" target="_blank">Windows Communictaion Foundation (WCF)</a> (formerly code-named <i>Indigo</i>) and I've to admit that, even coming from Java-land, I'm having lots of fun with <a href="http://wcf.netfx3.com/" target="_blank">WCF</a> and think it's a great platform for building Web Services.<br /><br />Apart from the <a href="http://soya.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/soya/" target="_blank">source-code</a>, not much information about <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soya" target="_blank">Soya</a> has been published yet. About two weeks ago, however, <a href="http://jim.webber.name/" target="_blank">Jim</a> and I submitted a paper to the <a href="http://www2007.org/" target="_blank">www2007</a> conference in which we presented our ideas revolving around <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soya" target="_blank">Soya</a>.<br /><br />The notification date whether the paper got accepted is at the end of January 07. Fingers x-ed that it will get through...</div>
