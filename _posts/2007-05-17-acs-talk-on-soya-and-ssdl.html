As many of you might have seen on <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2007/05/15/f6847c37-a438-4dcc-b4d6-4d39ddd494f7.aspx" target="_blank">Jim's blog</a> - who was ahead of me, as usual - I'm giving <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/acs_events/index.cfm?action=eventdetails&amp;eveID=2018" target="_blank">a little talk</a> on <a href="http://soya.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Soya</a> and <a href="http://www.ssdl.org" target="_blank">SSDL</a>. The talk is organized by the Australian Computer Society and will talk place on June 6, 2007 from 6.15pm to 7.30pm in the Norman Selfe Room, Level 3 280 Pitt St, Sydney (Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts).<br /><br />Not exactly sure, where Jim has gotten the information from that it will be a "fantastic" talk, but since I'll move back to Europe the following day, I'll try my best not to depart Australia in disgrace =)<br /><br />See you there!
