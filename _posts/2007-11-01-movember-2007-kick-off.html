No more shaving starting today. Some office mates (aka mo bros) have cajoled me into taking part in <a href="http://www.movember.com/" target="_blank">Movember</a>. The idea behind is to grow a moustache (i.e. mo) during the whole month of November to raise awareness and money for fighting prostate cancer.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet if I'll be posting pictures, but one of our colleagues (aka mo sista) will be taking pictures every 3 days in order to track each mo bro's individual progress.<br /><br />Oh well, one of these things I'll have to go through, I guess...
