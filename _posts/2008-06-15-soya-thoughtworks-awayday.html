Yesterday, I gave a talk on <a target="_blank" href="http://soya.sourceforge.net/">Soya</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> AwayDay. Some people have asked me if I could make the slides available and - even though they are basically just copies from previous talks - I have uploaded <a target="_blank" href="http://soya.sourceforge.net/files/soya-awayday-2008.pdf">the slides here</a>.<a target="_blank" href="http://soya.sourceforge.net/files/soya-awayday-2008.pdf"></a><br /><br />Also, you can download the <a target="_blank" href="http://soya.sourceforge.net/files/thesis.pdf">original thesis here.</a>
