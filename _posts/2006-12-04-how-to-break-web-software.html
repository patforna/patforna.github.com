Just watched a great video by Mike Andrews called <span style="font-style: italic;">How To Break Web Software - A look at security vulnerabilities in web software</span>.<br /><br />Mike talks about cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, HTTP response splitting and other things. He shows how easy it is to construct such attacks and ways you can prevent them.<br /><br />Check it out for yourself <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5159636580663884360&q=a&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.
