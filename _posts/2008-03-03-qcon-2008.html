Just got a one-day conference ticket for this year's <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/conference/">QCon</a> in London. I'll probably be attending most of the  <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=87">SOA, REST and the Web</a> sessions on Thursday, March 13.<br /><br />Really looking forward to going =)
