When using subversion, I more often than I'd like to admit find myself in need of starting with a clean working copy. Doing a normal (recursive) revert, however, does only undo changes from files that are already under version control and not newly added files which have to be removed separately.<br /><br />In order to remove all unversioned files from your working copy in one go, you can execute the following command. Think twice before using it, though ;)<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false;">svn st | grep "^\?" | sed "s/\? *//" | xargs rm -r</pre>
