When using subversion, I more often than I'd like to admit find myself in need of starting with a clean working copy. Doing a normal (recursive) revert, however, does only undo changes from files that are already under version control and not newly added files which have to be removed separately.<br /><br />In order to remove all unversioned files from your working copy in one go, you can execute the following command. Think twice before using it, though ;)<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false;">svn st | grep "^\?" | sed "s/\? *//" | xargs rm -r</pre></div>

I&#39;ve always used:<br /><br />svn st | awk &#39;/^\?/ {print $NF}&#39; | xargs -t rm</div>

This will only work if the files in question are not being &#39;ignored&#39; by svn.  Files matching the svn:ignore will not be displayed.  Interestingly I also noticed this behavior on all files and directories matching the global ignore patters in tortoisesvn.</div>
