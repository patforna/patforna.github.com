Today I have at last completed the last bit of my thesis submission: I have posted a hard copy of my final thesis version to the <a href="http://www.grs.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">Graduate Research School at UNSW</a> and also submitted it electronically to <a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/" target="_blank">ADT</a>.<br /><br />If you're interested, you can download the full thesis from the <a href="http://soya.sourceforge.net/publications.html" target="_blank">Soya web site</a>.<br /><br />A big thank you again to everybody for bearing with me and supporting me throughout the last 18 (or so) months =)</div>
