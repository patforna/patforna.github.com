<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I admit that for several years I have been reluctant to have my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Blog</a> and yet here I am writing the first few lines of it.<br /><br />I have realized that blogs are no longer just a form of online diaries, where people would write about their lives, which I always doubted would be interesting to a wide audience. No, blogs have become a medium for publishing professional and other useful information and are now an important source of knowledge that I use more and more in my everyday live.<br /><br />I suspect that future entries in this blog will mostly relate to software engineering topics, yet I'm not restraining myself beforehand and take the liberty of blogging about anything I  want to share - occasionally maybe even in different languages. Well, and isn't this what blogging is all about? ;)
