<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
The following piece of SQL is pretty handy for finding duplicate entries in a table. It will return all rows that have a single or aggregate column value which exist more than once in the given table.<br /><br /><span style=";font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">select column_x, column_y, column_z<br />from my_table<br />group by column_x, column_y, column_z<br />having count (*) > 1;</span>
