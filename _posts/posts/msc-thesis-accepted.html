<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I've just received the great news that my MSc thesis, which I've written over the last 1.5 years at <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">UNSW</a>, has been accepted =) The only thing left to do now is to make some minor corrections to it according to the examiner's reports. Then I can print and bind a final copy and send it at last to the <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">UNSW</a> library.
