So, you would have thought that 8 GB of disk space for your virtual machine would be enough to do a bit of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NET/">.NET</a> development (i.e. install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/">Windows XP</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio">Visual Studio 2008</a>). Unfortunately, I was wrong and had to make my virtualised partition bigger. Making the virtual disk bigger is very straight forward. Resizing the actual (primary active) Windows partition, however, is a bit less trivial.<br /><br />Here's what I did:<br /><ol><li>Resize the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a> disk file;<br /><pre>vmware-vdiskmanager -x 12GB /path/to/file.vmdk</pre></li><li>Get knoppix iso (or other bootable Linux iso);</li><li>Use iso for your virtual machine's CD-ROM;</li><li>Boot your virtual machine (i.e. boot using knoppix); *</li><li>Use <span style="font-family:courier new;">qtparted</span> (or any other suitable tool on your chosen Linux distro) to resize the bursting partition.<pre>sudo qtparted</pre></li></ol><br />* I had trouble hitting ESC fast enough to get into the boot menu and therefore had to tell VMware to slow down a bit:<br /><pre>echo 'bios.bootDelay="5000"' >> /path/to/file.vmx</pre></div>
