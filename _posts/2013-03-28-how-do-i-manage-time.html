<p>A friend of mine recently asked me what my secret to managing time was. Here's what my thoughts were:</p>
  
<p>Generally, there's always more work than I could possibly do. So, it's about deciding what's the most important thing to work on.</p>  

<p>I usually spend a few minutes in the morning to write down my priorities for the day on a piece of paper, which I carry with me throughout the day. Every now and then, I take a couple of minutes to review this list or tick things off. Whenever I'm spending more than a couple of minutes on something, I check the list to see if the task I'm working on is actually the most important thing I should be working on. If it's not, I either stop immediately or take a minute to re-prioritise. That way, I'm always fully aware that I'm spending my time on what I decided was most important.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I've got to say that I rarely feel that I'm not having enough time. I guess the reason for this is because I'm continuously aware of what my priorities are.</p>
