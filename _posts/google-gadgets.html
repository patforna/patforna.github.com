I find it always worthwhile to browse through <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a> from time to time to check out what Google has been up to recently and I'm almost never disappointed =)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Browser Sync</span><br />This time I found an extremely useful tool called <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/index.html">Google Browser Sync</a>. Essentially, it is a <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox </a>extension and synchronizes the browsers session across two or more different computers. It not only synchronizes bookmarks but also form field entries, browser history, open tabs, etc. I remember how annoying it was, when I knew that I was looking at a web site a few days ago but couldn't remember it and after looking at my browser's history realized that it was on a different computer (e.g. at work). Gone are these times and again, Google has made my life a little bit better =)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">GSpace</span><br />Another cool <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> extension (however, this one is not from <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a>) is called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1593/">GSpace</a>. It allows to use your <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> space as an online space for storing files.  The interface provides FTP-like access to your <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> account and allows dragging and dropping local files to your remote account or vice versa. All for free =)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reader</span><br />And last but not least, check out the all new <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> (September 28, 2006)  for comfortably reading your RSS or Atom feeds. They engineers at Google said that it can be thought of as an Inbox for the web and that's exactly how it feels like!
